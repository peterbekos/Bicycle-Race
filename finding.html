	<p> We found that there were many ages that were 0 or null or above 100. We didnt use those in our data. We found that people that there is a peak in use of Divvys during events like Lollapalooza, Air and Water Show, Design Harvest Fest, but after that the weather gets cold and no big events happening in Chicago that is when Divvys declines. <br> There are more male user's then female. </p>
